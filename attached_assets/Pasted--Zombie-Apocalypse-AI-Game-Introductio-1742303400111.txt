                                                              Zombie Apocalypse AI Game
Introduction
This project aims to create a survival-based Zombie Apocalypse game, where the player must navigate a dangerous world filled with AI-driven zombies. The zombies will use intelligent pathfinding and advanced AI mechanics such as horde behaviour, stealth detection, and adaptive AI to create a more immersive and challenging experience.
Objectives
1.	Understand the core mechanics of a survival game with AI-controlled enemies.
2.	Develop AI algorithms that control zombie movement, decision-making, and group behaviour.
3.	Explore different AI techniques such as pathfinding, state machines, and adaptive AI.
Project Scope
The project will involve developing the following key components:
1.	Game World: A grid-based environment representing a post-apocalyptic city.
2.	Player: A survivor who can move in four directions, scavenge for resources, and avoid zombies.
3.	Zombies (AI Enemies): Enemies that use advanced AI techniques such as:
o	Horde Behaviour: Zombies group together and dynamically track the player.
o	Stealth Detection: Zombies respond to noise and vision, making stealth tactics possible.
o	Adaptive AI: Zombies learn and adjust their behaviour based on the player’s actions.
4.	Resources: Items such as food, weapons, and medicine to help the player survive.
5.	Safe Zones & Traps: Areas where the player can rest or set up defenses against zombies.
6.	Game Logic: Rules governing player survival, zombie behavior, and interaction with the environment.
AI Techniques
1.	Pathfinding: Use algorithms like A or Dijkstra’s* to allow zombies to find the shortest path to the player.
2.	State Machines: Define different states for zombies (idle, searching, chasing, attacking) and transitions between them.
3.	Decision Trees: Implement decision-making processes for zombies to change behaviour based on the player’s actions.
4.	Zombie Horde Behaviour: Zombies move as a group toward the player, alerting others when they detect movement.
5.	Stealth Mechanics: Zombies detect players based on sound, vision cones, and lighting conditions.
6.	Adaptive AI: Zombies remember player movements, predict escape routes, and increase difficulty if the player survives too long.
Tools and Technologies
1.	Programming Language: Python
2.	Libraries:
o	Pygame (for game development)
o	NumPy (for calculations and AI logic)
o	Pathfinding libraries (for optimized AI movement)
3.	Development Environment: Any code editor or IDE
Conclusion
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional Zombie Apocalypse survival game featuring realistic AI-driven zombies that adapt to the player’s actions. This project will provide a deeper understanding of AI algorithms, stealth mechanics, and dynamic enemy behaviour, making it a valuable learning experience in game development and artificial intelligence.
